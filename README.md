Project Title: High Performance Computing with Python
Description:
This repository contains the implementation of the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) for fluid dynamics simulation using Python. The project leverages High Performance Computing (HPC) techniques, utilizing MPI for parallel execution. The code is designed to handle complex fluid dynamics problems efficiently, making it suitable for large-scale simulations.

Key Features:

Discretization of the Boltzmann transport equation for fluid simulations.
Implementation of periodic boundary conditions.
Parallel processing using MPI4Py for enhanced performance.
How to Run:

Install required Python packages (numpy, mpi4py).
Use the provided scripts to set up initial conditions and run simulations.
Visualize results using matplotlib.
